Throughout the semester, I gained valuable skills such as summarizing and presenting information creatively through posters, communicating effectively via videos, structuring and writing professional reports, adhering to technical standards in IEEE formatting, assembling and troubleshooting PC hardware in labs, and applying the design thinking process to create user-focused prototypes, all of which enhanced my critical thinking, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities.

Improvements for each assignment include exploring advanced tools for better design (poster, video, and prototypes), allocating more time for proofreading and peer reviews (report and technical paper), spending additional time practicing with diverse configurations (PC assembly), and conducting thorough user feedback during the prototype-testing phase (design thinking).

These assignments highlighted the real-world application of technology and information systems, instilled the importance of balancing creativity with logical structure, and reinforced how essential teamwork and adaptability are for professional growth in the technology field.
