## Overview

I concentrated on making a poster for assignment 1 based on the industry lecture that was supplied. The objective is to produce an eye-catching, educational poster with strong information and visuals. Using the given industry lecture as a guide, I concentrated on drafting an academic essay for assignment 3.
In addition to finding certain articles for citations and references, the objective is to present interesting and educational content.
