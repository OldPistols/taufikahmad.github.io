## Overview

The Design Thinking Project is a collaborative group task aimed at developing critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and communication skills. Students are required to apply the Design Thinking Process—a structured approach to solving problems through empathy, defining, ideation, prototyping, and testing—to create innovative solutions related to the theme of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence New Innovation. The project consists of three main deliverables:

## Report Writing:

- Contributed to writing the group report by documenting the design thinking process, including the phases of empathy, define, ideate, prototype, and testing.
- Helped compile evidence such as brainstorming ideas, team progress, and user feedback.
- Wrote detailed descriptions of the problem, proposed solution, and how our team collaborated effectively.
- Assisted in organizing the report with proper formatting, tables, and figures to enhance clarity and presentation.

## Video Creation:

- Participated in creating the project video by scripting and recording the steps of the design thinking process.
- Contributed to editing the video, ensuring it included visuals, team progress, and evidence for each phase (e.g., empathy questions, brainstorming sessions, and prototype testing).
- Ensured the video was within the 4-5 minute time limit and clearly communicated the project’s objectives and outcomes.

## Design Thinking Contributions:

- **Empathy Phase**: Helped create user personas by listing possible questions and answers based on user needs and backgrounds.
- **Define Phase**: Assisted in reframing the problem statement to focus on specific user needs and challenges.
- **Ideate Phase**: Actively participated in brainstorming sessions to generate innovative ideas and solutions.
- **Prototype Phase**: Contributed to building the low-fidelity prototype and documenting the development process.
- **Testing Phase**: Helped test the prototype with users, gathered feedback, and suggested improvements based on their input.

## Outcome

This project helped me understand the importance of user-centered design and how to approach problems creatively and systematically. It also prepared me for real-world challenges where collaboration, innovation, and adaptability are key to success.
